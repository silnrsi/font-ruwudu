title: Ruwudu - Design
fontversion: 3.000
---

Ruwudu is the Manga word for "writing". This style of writing is used by the Manga people in Niger, West Africa. This font was initially designed as a lighter or companion version of [Alkalami Regular](https://software.sil.org/alkalami/). The design is still very much influenced by the Rubutun Kano style, but was based on samples of footnotes from the market edition manuscripts. These were made with a monoline tool, likely a ball point pen or something similar. The extreme swashes and tails of Alkalami are replaced by more classic and reserved shapes. 

Four weights for this typeface family are included:

- Ruwudu Regular
- Ruwudu Medium
- Ruwudu SemiBold
- Ruwudu Bold
