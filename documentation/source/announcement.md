### Known issues

Because we reduced the line spacing for this font, there is the possibility of interline collisions which might require manual intervention. This would be most likely to occur in languages which use multiple jeem-like characters sequentially in one word. In this case, turning off the stacking behaviour of jeem-like characters (ss07) for one word could fix the interline collision.
