    <p>Ruwudu is the Manga word for "writing". This style of writing is used by the Manga people in Niger, West Africa. This font was initially designed as a lighter or companion version of <a href="https://software.sil.org/alkalami/">Alkalami Regular</a>. The design is still very much influenced by the Rubutun Kano style, but was based on samples of footnotes from the market edition manuscripts. These were made with a monoline tool, likely a ball point pen or something similar. The extreme swashes and tails of Alkalami are replaced by more classic and reserved shapes.</p>
