Ruwudu font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Ruwudu font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Ruwudu font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Ruwudu is the Manga word for "writing". This style of writing is used by the Manga 
people in Niger, West Africa. This font was initially designed as a lighter or 
companion version of Alkalami Regular (https://software.sil.org/alkalami/). The 
design is still very much influenced by the Rubutun Kano style, but was based on 
samples of footnotes from the market edition manuscripts. These were made with a 
monoline tool, likely a ball point pen or something similar. The extreme swashes 
and tails of Alkalami are replaced by more classic and reserved shapes. 

This font supports the characters known to be used by languages written in this
style of Arabic script, but may not have the characters needed for other
languages.

This font utilizes state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType only. We have
no current plans to support Graphite.

Four weights for this typeface family are included:
     * Ruwudu Regular
     * Ruwudu Medium
     * Ruwudu SemiBold
     * Ruwudu Bold

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Ruwudu" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Ruwudu.
However, SIL Global (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used,
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and
"Ruwudu" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named
"Ruwudu Warsh" but a derivative of that font made
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Ruwudu" and "SIL"
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Scribe Foo".
